- DynamoDB (customer data)
- Aurora Serverless (analytics)
- Bedrock (AI/ML)
- EventBridge (automation)
- SES (email notifications)
```

### Frontend (Fast Development)
```typescript
// React Stack
- Next.js 14 (full-stack framework)
- TypeScript (type safety)
- Tailwind CSS (rapid styling)
- Recharts (data visualization)
- React Query (data fetching)
- Zustand (state management)
```

### AI/ML (Managed Services)
